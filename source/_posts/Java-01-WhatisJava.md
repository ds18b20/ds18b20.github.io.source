# What is Java

Java technology is both a programming language and a platform.

Java programs are compiled and interpreted. Compilation translate Java code to an intermediate language called Java bytecode.  bytecode is in turn parsed and run(interpreted) by the Java Virtual Machine(JVM)-a translator between Java language and a underlying operating system and hardware. A compiled Java bytecode can run on any system that has a version of JVM.

The Java platform is a software-only platform that can run on top of most hardware platforms. It consists of the JVM and the Java API.

Java Platform comes in 3 versions:

- Java SE(Java Platform, Standard Edition) for desktop and sever applications.
- Java EE(Java Platform, Enterprise Edition) for web and enterprise applications.
- Java ME(Java Platform, Micro Edition) for applications running on resource-constrained devices(embedded device).
